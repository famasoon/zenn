I built v8 to run fuzzing in AFL.
First, install `depot_tools` using the link below.
And then download the `v8` source code.

https://v8.dev/docs/source-code

Next, create an `afl` directory in the `v8/third_party` directory and download the contents of the following link.

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/master/third_party/afl/

Next, go to the `v8` directory and execute the following command.

```
gn gen out/libfuzzer '--args=use_afl=true is_asan=true optimize_for_fuzzing = true ' --check
ninja -C out/libfuzzer d8
afl-fuzz -D -i third_party/afl/src/testcases/others/js/ -o fuzzout -M fuzz1 ./out/libfuzzer/d8
```

This was a `afl-g++` based fuzzing method.
You can probably use `clang` for faster fuzzing.
You can also use `fuzzilli` or `Dharma` for fuzzing.
